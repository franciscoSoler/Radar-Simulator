abstract = {This paper presents pattern synthesis methods and calibration methods for the conformal array antennas (CAAs). First, the authors show two types of the pattern synthesis methods, the projection method and the null points adjusting method. These have been developed in order to obtain low sidelobe characteristics for the CAAs. Next, the authors present the rotating-element electric-field vector (REV) method for CAA calibration. This method is able to measure relative amplitude and phase of an electric field vector radiated from each element antenna including mutual coupling effects by only measuring the composite power radiated from the array. The authors also present the modified REV method. This can measure amplitude and phase error of each bit of a digital phase shifter by the composite amplitude and phase.},

abstract = {The SIR-C/X-SAR imaging radar took its first flight on the Space
Shuttle Endeavour in April 1994 and flew for a second time in October
1994. This multifrequency radar has fully polarimetric capability at L-
and C-band, and a single polarization at X-band (X-SAR). The Endeavour
missions were designated the Space Radar Laboratory-1 (SRL-1) and -2
(SRL-2). Calibration of polarimetric L- and C-band data for all the
different modes SIR-C offers is an especially complicated problem. The
solution involves extensive analysis of pre-flight test data to come up
with a model of the system, analysis of in-flight test data to determine
the antenna pattern and gains of the system during operation, and
analysis of data from over fourteen calibration sites distributed around
the SIR-C/X-SAR orbit track. The SRL missions were the first time a
multifrequency polarimetric imaging radar employing a phased array
antenna has been flown in space. Calibration of SIR-C data products
involved some unique technical problems given the complexity of the
radar system. In this paper, the approach adopted for calibration of
SIR-C data is described and the calibration performance of the data
products is presented},

abstract = {Radar systems are engineered to achieve a complex, yet functional, balance between diverse subsystems and competing requirements. One important trade for large deployable space radar antennas is between antenna dimensional stability and electronic signal processing for deformation compensation. This trade is first investigated for several different electronic compensation methods, and compensation capabilities are mapped into structural requirements. Second the structural requirements are translated into appropriate structural architectures. The scope of this study is limited to space radar systems, where loads causing antenna deformations differ significantly from terrestrial systems. Compensation strategies that allow structural requirements to be reduced by several orders of magnitude are identified. When considered early in the systems engineering process, the methods presented herein can be used to form a rationale for the selection and the development of a complementary combination of compensation electronics and structural architectures.},

abstract = { Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coverage is provided by RADARSAT using a multiple-beam scanning strategy called ScanSAR. Each beam covers a different range, and is allocated a fixed period of time in which to transmit and receive radar pulses. During SAR processing, the data from each beam must be "stitched" together to form a complete image of the scanned area. This data must be radiometrically calibrated to compensate for antenna beam patterns. However, incorrect measurements of the satellite roll angle cause errors in radiometric calibration, and can lead to visible artifacts in the image (e.g. banding). A new ScanSAR data acquisition technique is proposed that improves roll angle estimation through the use of radar pulses, transmitted by one beam and received by another. The new data are called "hybrid beam data" and can be utilized with modified versions of existing roll estimation algorithms. This paper shows how the hybrid beam data are collected, accommodating pulse repetition frequency, range gate delay, and other timing changes as beams are switched.},

to perform simultaneous measurements of all the array elements thus
obtaining an estimate of the relative phases and amplitudes in less than

encoded and Doppler shifted signal from which the element phase and
amplitudes are recovered. Post processing techniques are used to
determine electrical and mechanical distortion errors from the phase

allow mechanical designers to relax mechanical deployment and tolerance
specifications for the phased array antenna. The capacity to relax
mechanical requirements may result in a simpler mechanical design which
reduces cost and mass of the antenna system},

abstract = {RADARSAT, the first Canadian earth observation satellite, is scheduled for launch in 1995. The mission is to provide to users calibrated C-band HH polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data products for five years, at different incidence angles, resolution and area coverage. The SAR is also designed to operate in the ScanSAR mode by combining different elevation beams. Emphasis in the RADARSAT Program is provision of operationally calibrated products which insures targets can be compared radiometrically within each scene and between scenes. In order to maintain end-to-end radiometric quality for the mission life, plans are to perform external calibration routinely using precision transponders and homogeneous targets. The calibration data will be analyzed off-line in the calibration workstation and resulting calibration parameters update will be provided to the ground processor to generate calibrated products. The short term variations in the gain of the sensor electronics will be tracked by the on board internal calibration system and these calibration data will be transmitted to the ground with the radar signal data. This allows the processor to automatically compensate for radar gain variations in between the external calibration periods and thus maintain the required radiometric accuracy. This paper describes the calibration requirements for the mission and plans for internal and external calibrations. An outline of the image quality management is also presented.},

Large phased arrays in space are likely to experience mechanical deformation both at the sub-array panel level and across the structure as a whole.

abstract = {Since its launch on November 4, 1995 and the start of the routine operation on April 1, 1996, RADARSAT-1, the first Canadian Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing satellite, has provided calibrated data to worldwide users for their intended applications. From the early qualification stages of the mission, both single beams and ScanSAR operating modes are monitored routinely for radiometric calibration performance using images of the Amazon Rainforest, and for image quality performance using images of RADARSAT-1 Precision Transponders. After the initial Calibration Phase and the Antarctic Mapping Mission in 1997, a systematic calibration monitoring strategy showed changes in the characteristics of several previously calibrated elevation antenna patterns. Compensations for these changes are made in the processor by re-calibrating the beams. In addition, a major upgrade of the ScanSAR processor completed at the Canadian Data Processing Facility (CDPF) in 2002 yielded to significant improvements in image quality and radiometry. Throughout the nominal mission life of 5 years and the 3 years of the current extended mission, which started in early 2001, the Canadian Data Processing Facility continued to provide radiometrically and geometrically calibrated RADARSAT-1 products to users. In late October 2000, concerns began to rise of the possibility of failure of the Horizon Scanner 1, which would result in operating the spacecraft in a mode known as 'Attitude Determination Method 3' (ADM3), causing a decrease in attitude control performance of the spacecraft compared to the current operation in primary ADM1. Experiments were conducted to better understand the impact on processing and image quality when in ADM3 mode. No major impact on image quality was noticed with adapted re-processing. In mid 2002, due to aging considerations for the On-Board Recorder, natural sites within Canadian data reception masks have been envisioned for their potential to support radiometric analyses, as an alternative to the Amazon Rainforest where images are recorded. From several sites, a Boreal Forest location near Hearst, Ontario, Canada was chosen for testing radiometric measurements, using specific beams to cover the entire range of incidence angles. ?? 2006 COSPAR.},

@article{Schwerdt2005,
abstract = {TerraSAR-X is a high-resolution X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite due for launch in 2006. The sensor has a spatial resolution down to 1 m and operates in Stripmap, Spotlight, and ScanSAR modes with selectable or dual polarization. It can image on the left or right side of the subsatellite track, which is achieved by rolling the satellite. There are also experimental modes for wide bandwidth, providing even higher resolution, and for full polarization and along-track interferometry (ATI), the latter two being achieved by splitting the receive antenna into two halves. Owing to this high degree of flexibility of the instrument and the tight performance requirements, the calibration of the sensor is a major challenge, and new concepts are needed to keep the costs affordable. For this purpose a novel internal calibration concept was developed, the so-called PN-gating method. In using this method, individual transmit and receive modules can be characterized under the most realistic conditions. Furthermore, cost-effect concepts for external calibration are mandatory because of the large number of modes and possible antenna patterns. The characterization of the antenna is based on a precise antenna pattern model, which provides reference patterns required for the relative radiometric correction of the SAR data. The paper describes the calibration measures planned for the TerraSAR-X instrument and discusses their implementation. The concept is applicable to other advanced SAR sensors.},

abstract = {With the new demands for SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), such as
variable off-nadir and SCAN SAR, phased array radar technology is
required for most of the next generation spaceborne SARs. Radiometric
calibration of active phased array type SARs, however, is a very
complicated task, because they have hundreds of active devices and phase
shifters to be calibrated. In this paper, the authors have conducted a
study on the internal calibration method for phased array type SAR.
First, they derive the error sources of such kind of SARs. These are
mainly divided into two categories, the variation in antenna and the
variation in transmitter/receiver. Modified REV (Rotating Element
Electric Field Vector) method, M. Seiji et al. (1982), is proposed for
the calibration of antenna subsystem. By the compensation, the optimal
antenna pattern can be maintained to keep high S/A and S/N of the SAR
image, and the accurate antenna gain can be estimated For the
calibration of transmitter/receiver, tone signal method and ERP
(Effective Radiated Power) measurement method using REV antenna is
proposed. By the compensation, the total gain variation of
transmitter/receiver chains can be estimated. It is shown that the
radiometric accuracy of 0.8 dB can be obtained by the above calibration
methods together with the standard external calibration methods},

In this paper, a system concept will be presented to measure array deformation and provide phase compensation information with which the received data can be corrected. Such realtime measurement and compensation of array vibrations may considerably improve the performance of operational systems. Therefore, a study was started to investigate the feasibility of this concept. Shaker experiments proved that the required measurement accuracy is within reach using off-the-shelf sensors and suitable signal processing.},

The first calibration technique utilizes cold and hot load measurements to construct calibration curves. For our case, we used sky as the cold load and microwave absorber at ambient temperature as hot load. The second calibration technique utilizes measurements of the brightness temperature of the sky at various zenith angles to determine the atmospheric opacity needed for the calibration curves. The third calibration technique utilizes measurements of internal reference load and micro-controller inside the radiometer at both polarizations to estimate the system gain fluctuations and the receiver noise temperatures. We calibrated our University of Florida C-band Microwave Radiometer (UFCMR) every two weeks during the first Microwave Water and Energy Balance Experiment (MicroWEX-1). We found that, the first and third techniques produced similar calibration results with 1 Kelvin/volt standard deviation. However, the third technique was the most stable during the entire experiment with the smallest standard deviations which were 2.41 Kelvin/volt for the slope of the calibration curves at H-pol and 7.46 Kelvin/volt for the slope of the calibration curves at V-pol during MicroWEX-1},

calibration target deployment compared to external calibration.
Therefore the Electromagnetics Institute (EMI) at the Technical
University of Denmark (TUD) has equipped its polarimetric SAR, EMISAR,
with several calibration loops and developed a procedure for calibrating
the entire system except a few passive components which must be measured
in the laboratory. The calibration procedure has great potential as it
takes into account the SAR point target response (PTR) unlike most other
internal calibration schemes. However, it requires a highly stable

Two lightweight phased arrays, mounted on opposite sides of the spacecraft, provide the high-gain downlink coverage. Techniques for measurement of the phased-array antenna system include ambient temperature measurements in a compact antenna range, thermal vacuum testing, and spacecraft-level testing. There have been two novel developments in the characterization of the phased-array system. The first is a "gain envelope" response, which is a measurement of the gain of the array at the intended scan angle as the array is electrically scanned in 1\&amp;deg; increments. This response was produced through a combination of hardware and test software to synchronize the gain measurement with the mechanical and electrical scanning. The second is a phase-steering verification test that utilizes couplers in each steered element in conjunction with previously measured element patterns to confirm that the antenna beam is steered property. This method allows functional verification of the phased-array system while radiating into an RF-absorber-lined hat during spacecraft-level tests.},

abstract = {A method to measure the antenna elevation pattern of synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) using distributed targets is introduced. The
features of the method are (1) the antenna pattern model parameters are
estimated as the solutions of maximum likelihood estimation; (2) To
guarantee the uniformity, a screening process based on a chi-square
similarity test is applied to the image data; and (3) Noise generated in
the SAR receiver and data processor tends to broaden the estimated
antenna pattern. To improve it, the estimated noise level is subtracted
from the image data. The authors assume that the scattering coefficient
over the evaluated images is unknown yet constant (although this could
easily be extended to the case where the variation of \&amp;gamma; or
\&amp;sigma;\&amp;deg; with incidence angle is known), Three types of antenna
pattern models are tested, Among them, the best result is given by a
fourth order power model. This technique is applied to selected image
data sets from the SIR-B mission, including several scenes analyzed
previously by Moore from the Amazon rain forest and Illinois farmland.
For the Amazon data (which give the best results), the authors found
that the technique adopted in the paper gives residual errors on the
antenna pattern fit of less than 0.08 dB for a given scene. Applying the
antenna pattern estimated from one scene to others, residual errors of
less than 0.3 dB are achieved},

Sinusoidal deformations for frequencies of 1, 2, and 3 Hz in the x-direction are examined. For all types of deformations, peak-to-peak errors from 0.1 to 0.5 inches are investigated. Beam pointing error increases with both decreasing array size and increasing deformation asymmetry. Main beam gain loss does not change with array size, but increases with increasing deformation asymmetry and decreases with increasing scan angle.

One important trade for large deployable space radar antennas is between antenna dimensional stability and electronic signal processing for deformation compensation. This trade is first investigated for several different electronic compensation methods, and compensation capabilities are mapped into structural requirements. Second the structural requirements are translated into appropriate structural architectures. The scope of this study is limited to space radar systems, where loads causing antenna deformations differ significantly from terrestrial systems. Compensation strategies that allow structural requirements to be reduced by several orders of magnitude are identified. When considered early in the systems engineering process, the methods presented herein can be used to form a rationale for the selection and the development of a complementary combination of compensation electronics and structural architectures.},

The first calibration technique utilizes cold and hot load measurements to construct calibration curves. For our case, we used sky as the cold load and microwave absorber at ambient temperature as hot load. The second calibration technique utilizes measurements of the brightness temperature of the sky at various zenith angles to determine the atmospheric opacity needed for the calibration curves. The third calibration technique utilizes measurements of internal reference load and micro-controller inside the radiometer at both polarizations to estimate the system gain fluctuations and the receiver noise temperatures. We calibrated our University of Florida C-band Microwave Radiometer (UFCMR) every two weeks during the first Microwave Water and Energy Balance Experiment (MicroWEX-1). We found that, the first and third techniques produced similar calibration results with 1 Kelvin/volt standard deviation. However, the third technique was the most stable during the entire experiment with the smallest standard deviations which were 2.41 Kelvin/volt for the slope of the calibration curves at H-pol and 7.46 Kelvin/volt for the slope of the calibration curves at V-pol during MicroWEX-1},

Phased array diameters of 7.5 and 15 feet are examined. The array face deformations can have a sag, potato chip, sinusoidal or Bessel character. The sag, potato chip, and Bessel deformations can be asymmetric with the peak deformations as far as 0.50 radii from the center of the array in any direction. Sinusoidal deformations for frequencies of 1, 2, and 3 Hz in the x-direction are examined. For all types of deformations, peak-to-peak errors from 0.1 to 0.5 inches are investigated. Beam pointing error increases with both decreasing array size and increasing deformation asymmetry. Main beam gain loss does not change with array size, but increases with increasing deformation asymmetry and decreases with increasing scan angle. Both beam pointing error and gain loss can be compensated with element level phase corrections if the deformation profile is known accurately.},

features of the method are (1) the antenna pattern model parameters are
estimated as the solutions of maximum likelihood estimation; (2) To
guarantee the uniformity, a screening process based on a chi-square
similarity test is applied to the image data; and (3) Noise generated in
the SAR receiver and data processor tends to broaden the estimated
antenna pattern. To improve it, the estimated noise level is subtracted
from the image data. The authors assume that the scattering coefficient
over the evaluated images is unknown yet constant (although this could
easily be extended to the case where the variation of \&amp;gamma; or
\&amp;sigma;\&amp;deg; with incidence angle is known), Three types of antenna
pattern models are tested, Among them, the best result is given by a
fourth order power model. This technique is applied to selected image
data sets from the SIR-B mission, including several scenes analyzed
previously by Moore from the Amazon rain forest and Illinois farmland.
For the Amazon data (which give the best results), the authors found
that the technique adopted in the paper gives residual errors on the
antenna pattern fit of less than 0.08 dB for a given scene. Applying the
antenna pattern estimated from one scene to others, residual errors of
less than 0.3 dB are achieved},

abstract = {The MESSENGER spacecraft, designed to orbit the planet Mercury, uses the first electronically scanned phased-array antenna for a deep-space telecommunication application. Two lightweight phased arrays, mounted on opposite sides of the spacecraft, provide the high-gain downlink coverage. Techniques for measurement of the phased-array antenna system include ambient temperature measurements in a compact antenna range, thermal vacuum testing, and spacecraft-level testing. There have been two novel developments in the characterization of the phased-array system. The first is a "gain envelope" response, which is a measurement of the gain of the array at the intended scan angle as the array is electrically scanned in 1\&amp;deg; increments. This response was produced through a combination of hardware and test software to synchronize the gain measurement with the mechanical and electrical scanning. The second is a phase-steering verification test that utilizes couplers in each steered element in conjunction with previously measured element patterns to confirm that the antenna beam is steered property. This method allows functional verification of the phased-array system while radiating into an RF-absorber-lined hat during spacecraft-level tests.},

abstract = {Since its launch on November 4, 1995 and the start of the routine operation on April 1, 1996, RADARSAT-1, the first Canadian Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing satellite, has provided calibrated data to worldwide users for their intended applications. From the early qualification stages of the mission, both single beams and ScanSAR operating modes are monitored routinely for radiometric calibration performance using images of the Amazon Rainforest, and for image quality performance using images of RADARSAT-1 Precision Transponders. After the initial Calibration Phase and the Antarctic Mapping Mission in 1997, a systematic calibration monitoring strategy showed changes in the characteristics of several previously calibrated elevation antenna patterns. Compensations for these changes are made in the processor by re-calibrating the beams. In addition, a major upgrade of the ScanSAR processor completed at the Canadian Data Processing Facility (CDPF) in 2002 yielded to significant improvements in image quality and radiometry. Throughout the nominal mission life of 5 years and the 3 years of the current extended mission, which started in early 2001, the Canadian Data Processing Facility continued to provide radiometrically and geometrically calibrated RADARSAT-1 products to users. In late October 2000, concerns began to rise of the possibility of failure of the Horizon Scanner 1, which would result in operating the spacecraft in a mode known as 'Attitude Determination Method 3' (ADM3), causing a decrease in attitude control performance of the spacecraft compared to the current operation in primary ADM1. Experiments were conducted to better understand the impact on processing and image quality when in ADM3 mode. No major impact on image quality was noticed with adapted re-processing. In mid 2002, due to aging considerations for the On-Board Recorder, natural sites within Canadian data reception masks have been envisioned for their potential to support radiometric analyses, as an alternative to the Amazon Rainforest where images are recorded. From several sites, a Boreal Forest location near Hearst, Ontario, Canada was chosen for testing radiometric measurements, using specific beams to cover the entire range of incidence angles. ?? 2006 COSPAR.},

abstract = {Phased array antennas are increasingly used in modern radar systems. Such systems are very liable to distortion of the relative phases between the radiating elements. For airborne, spaceborne, and naval phased array systems, vibrations of the array structure are an important source of phase distortions. In this paper, a system concept will be presented to measure array deformation and provide phase compensation information with which the received data can be corrected. Such realtime measurement and compensation of array vibrations may considerably improve the performance of operational systems. Therefore, a study was started to investigate the feasibility of this concept. Shaker experiments proved that the required measurement accuracy is within reach using off-the-shelf sensors and suitable signal processing.},

abstract = {This paper presents pattern synthesis methods and calibration methods for the conformal array antennas (CAAs). First, the authors show two types of the pattern synthesis methods, the projection method and the null points adjusting method. These have been developed in order to obtain low sidelobe characteristics for the CAAs. Next, the authors present the rotating-element electric-field vector (REV) method for CAA calibration. This method is able to measure relative amplitude and phase of an electric field vector radiated from each element antenna including mutual coupling effects by only measuring the composite power radiated from the array. The authors also present the modified REV method. This can measure amplitude and phase error of each bit of a digital phase shifter by the composite amplitude and phase.},

abstract = {The SIR-C/X-SAR imaging radar took its first flight on the Space
Shuttle Endeavour in April 1994 and flew for a second time in October
1994. This multifrequency radar has fully polarimetric capability at L-
and C-band, and a single polarization at X-band (X-SAR). The Endeavour
missions were designated the Space Radar Laboratory-1 (SRL-1) and -2
(SRL-2). Calibration of polarimetric L- and C-band data for all the
different modes SIR-C offers is an especially complicated problem. The
solution involves extensive analysis of pre-flight test data to come up
with a model of the system, analysis of in-flight test data to determine
the antenna pattern and gains of the system during operation, and
analysis of data from over fourteen calibration sites distributed around
the SIR-C/X-SAR orbit track. The SRL missions were the first time a
multifrequency polarimetric imaging radar employing a phased array
antenna has been flown in space. Calibration of SIR-C data products
involved some unique technical problems given the complexity of the
radar system. In this paper, the approach adopted for calibration of
SIR-C data is described and the calibration performance of the data
products is presented},

@article{Cumming2004,
abstract = { Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coverage is provided by RADARSAT using a multiple-beam scanning strategy called ScanSAR. Each beam covers a different range, and is allocated a fixed period of time in which to transmit and receive radar pulses. During SAR processing, the data from each beam must be "stitched" together to form a complete image of the scanned area. This data must be radiometrically calibrated to compensate for antenna beam patterns. However, incorrect measurements of the satellite roll angle cause errors in radiometric calibration, and can lead to visible artifacts in the image (e.g. banding). A new ScanSAR data acquisition technique is proposed that improves roll angle estimation through the use of radar pulses, transmitted by one beam and received by another. The new data are called "hybrid beam data" and can be utilized with modified versions of existing roll estimation algorithms. This paper shows how the hybrid beam data are collected, accommodating pulse repetition frequency, range gate delay, and other timing changes as beams are switched.},

The radar is designed to operate in a variety of modes including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and moving target indication (MTI).

Its active phased array X-Band antenna hosts 384 transmit/receive mod- ules controlling the beam steering in azimuth and elevation direction. Precise modelling of the antenna is only possible if the actual characteristics of each individual transmit/receive module are known. TerraSAR-X has been equipped with an innovative characterisation mode based on the so-called PN Gating method. Individual and simultaneous characterisation of all transmit/receive modules is realised under most realistic conditions with the same power loads like in the nominal mode. This paper shows the results of PN Gating measurements on a satellite SAR system.
