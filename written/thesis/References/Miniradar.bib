abstract = {The LM2990 is a three-terminal, low dropout, 1 ampere negative voltage regulator available with fixed output voltages of −5, −5.2, −12, and −15V. The LM2990 uses new circuit design techniques to provide low dropout and low quiescent current. The dropout voltage at 1A load current is typically 0.6V and a guaranteed worstcase maximum of 1V over the entire operating temperature range. The quiescent current is typically 1 mA with 1A load current and an input-output voltage differential greater than 3V. A unique circuit design of the internal bias supply limits the quiescent current to only 9 mA (typical) when the regulator is in the dropout mode (VOUT − VIN ≤ 3V). Output voltage accuracy is guaranteed to ±5{\%} over load, and temperature extremes. The LM2990 is short-circuit proof, and thermal shutdown includes hysteresis to enhance the reliability of the device when overloaded for an extended period of time. The LM2990 is available in a 3-lead TO-220 package and is rated for operation over the automotive temperature range of −40°C to +125°C.},

@book{Richards2009,
abstract = {This book treats the technology of radar imaging for remote sensing applications in a manner suited to the mathematical background of most earth scientists. It assumes no prior knowledge of radar on the part of the reader; instead it commences with a development of the essential concepts of radar before progressing through to a detailed coverage of contemporary ideas such as polarimetry and interferometry. Because the technology of radar imaging is potentially complex the first chapter provides a framework against which the rest of the book is set. Together, the first four chapters present the technical foundations for remote sensing with imaging radar. Scattering concepts are then covered so that the reader develops the knowledge necessary for interpreting radar data, itself the topic of a later chapter which draws together the current thinking in the analysis of radar imagery. The treatment is based on the assumption that the radars of interest are, in general, multi-polarised. Polarisation synthesis and polarised interferometric SAR are among the topics covered, as are tomography and the various forms of interferometry. A full chapter is given to bistatic radar, which is now emerging as an imaging technology with enormous potential and flexibility in remote sensing. The book concludes with a summary of passive microwave imaging. A set of appendices is included that provide supplementary material, among which is an overview of the rather complicated process of image formation with synthetic aperture radar, and summaries of some of the mathematical procedures important for a full appreciation of radar as a remote sensing technology.},

@article{steppedFreq,
abstract = {—In radar system, for detecting targets in the strong background clutters, separation of the target requires high range and cross-range resolution in the system. The high range resolution is obtained by utilizing shorter pulses and wideband-FM pulses, therefore, an expensive wideband receiver should be implemented. The alternative system to achieving high range resolution without using wideband receiver is the stepped frequency (SF) radar scheme performed synthetic range profile (SRP) processing. The principle of this radar is that the echoes of stepped frequency pulses are synthesized in the frequency domain to give the shorter pulses in the time domain thorough the IDFT. The SF radar causes some problems due to the Doppler shift when it is applied to detect moving targets. In particular, if the system assumes the fixed synthetic bandwidth and the target velocity, the influence of Doppler shift is greatly affected by the duration of the observation time, which is determined by the frequency step number and the pulse repetition interval. In this paper, we propose the phase coded stepped frequency (PCSF) radar with using intra-pulse phase coded modulation on each SF pulse. It aims to realize the required synthetic bandwidth by fewer frequency steps. The effectiveness of the PCSF radar performing the Doppler compensation is proved even under low signal-to-noise (SNR) circumstances.},

Owing to their role in helping to control the ice sheet contribution to sea level change there is great interest in measuring the rate at which they are melting into the ocean. This study describes the development and deployment of an ice-penetrating phase-sensitive FMCW radar, sufficiently robust and with sufficiently low-power consumption to be run through the Antarctic winter as a standalone instrument, yet with the stability and mm-precision needed to detect the very slow changes in ice shelf thickness in this exceptionally demanding environment. A number of elegant processing techniques are described to achieve reliable, high-precision performance and results presented on field data obtained from the Larsen-C ice shelf, Antarctica.},

The author develops the basic theory independently for each of the transform domains and provides illustrative examples throughout to aid the reader. Discussions of applications in the areas of speech processing, consumer electronics, acoustics, radar, geophysical signal processing, and remote sensing help to place the theory in context.

abstract = {The frequency-modulated continuous wave-radars - (FMCW-radars) are widely applied in the car road safety systems, the aircraft altimeters, the fusion plasma microwave diagnostics and in other ranging systems of different usage. The most optimal choice in terms of the "cost-quality" criterion for the radars that function at tens of meters distances is a transceiving set homodyne circuitry preference. The Gunn oscillators and Schottky diode barrier mixers usage in such radar sets let one create solid-state midget microwave detectors of different purposes. However, designing the transceiving set-based measuring system, one is confronted with a number of difficulties, depended on the high requirements over the transmitted waveshape and the generator and reception path gain frequency responses linearity.},
