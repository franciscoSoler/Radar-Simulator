The calculation method and the measurement procedure for the new mutual impedance are given. Measurement and theoretical results on two monopole antennas were obtained as an example. The new mutual impedance was successfully applied in the compensation of the mutual coupling effect in direction finding and adaptive interference suppression with significantly improved results, showing the importance of the new mutual impedance.},

@article{Allen1966,
abstract = {The report summarizes the current level of understanding of the performance of arrays of real radiators. The extent and nature of the effects of mutual coupling (element pattern distortion, element impedance variation with scan angle, and polarization variation with scan angle) in array antennas are investigated for a variety of array geometries and for several types of radiating elements. Both finite and infinite arrays of regularly spaced, uniformly illuminated, and progressively phased elements are considered. The effects of coupling on unequally spaced arrays, arrays with coupled feed networks, and circularly polarized arrays are also discussed. Finally, the results of a study of the effects of coupling on the radiation patterns of multiple-beam optical-type antennas are presented. Although most of the numerical results are based on thin, dipole radiating elements with and without ground planes (the dipole without a ground plane is the exact dual of an array of slots in a ground plane), both theoretical and experimental investigations of the sensitivity of the results to the element type are included. Emphasis is placed on the results of various analyses and their implications to the array designer. The derivations of some of the more important results are briefly outlined, but in most instances, only the relevant conclusions are given.},

@article{Gupta1983,
abstract = {In this study, performance of the array signal processing algorithms which are used for interference mitigation in radar and communication systems is analyzed while regarding the electromagnetic properties of the antenna elements. In real world applications electromagnetic characteristics of the antenna array have very significant effect on the performance of the algorithms and sometimes may cause a complete fail of the process. In the paper, particularly, effects of the mutual coupling are presented. Performances of the Schelkunoff array synthesis method, least-squares (LS) method and the least mean square (LMS) algorithms for interference suppression in adaptive array with dipole elements are analyzed. Null depth, nulling bandwidth, signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and the changes in the fundamental properties of the array pattern are observed for different scenarios},

@article{Lui2009,
abstract = {In antenna arrays, mutual coupling between antenna elements is well known as an undesired effect, which degrades the performance of array signal-processing algorithms. The compensation of such an undesired effect has been a popular research topic throughout the years. Various approaches for mutual-coupling compensation have been developed, and they can easily be found in the open literature. In general, the mutual-coupling problems for a transmitting and receiving array are different, even if the physical geometry of the array remains unchanged. However, it seems that antenna engineers are not well aware of such differences in the analysis of receiving antenna arrays. In this note, the mutual-coupling problems in transmitting and receiving antenna arrays are revisited. The differences between the mutual coupling and mutual impedances for transmitting and receiving antenna arrays are explained. It is concluded that the mutual-coupling problems of transmitting and receiving arrays are in general different, and hence different mutual impedances should be used for mutual-coupling analysis and compensation.},

abstract = { A new and practical method is proposed to compensate for the mutual coupling effect in a dipole array deployed for direction finding. This method does not require either the current distributions on the antenna elements or the elevation angles of the incoming signals to be known. A new definition of mutual impedance is introduced to characterize the effect due to mutual coupling between dipole elements. The new mutual impedances are calculated based on an estimated current distribution. It is shown that the current method has a significantly better ability to compensate for the mutual coupling effect than previous methods. Computer simulations using the MUSIC algorithm are provided to demonstrate this method.},

Comparisons are made with the case of using the conventional mutual impedances for mutual coupling compensation. All experiments are carried out inside an anechoic chamber.

abstract = {The performance of an antenna is changed whenever it is placed within the field of another antenna because of the existence of mutual coupling. The concept of receiving mutual impedance was introduced to characterize the mutual coupling effect in receiving antenna arrays and has been successfully applied in many occasions, such as direction finding, adaptive nulling, and medical imaging. In this paper, the definition of receiving mutual impedance is extended to characterize the mutual impedance coupling effect in two patch antennas operating in a rich multipath environment. In the extended definition, the two antennas are excited by a larger number plane waves coming from different directions. The behaviour of the receiving mutual impedances when the antennas are excited by different number of plane waves is studied and compared with the case of omni-directional antennas. This extends the use of receiving mutual impedance to non-omni-directional antennas for operation in multipath environments and has an implication for receiving antenna array design for multi-antenna systems such as MIMO systems.},
